A block editor based on the one described in Starting Forth. It may seem weird that the code is in a file that I edited with vim, but I needed a starting point. Now I can run gforth and include blockedit.fs to then edit Forth in blocks. The documentation is in Starting Forth. The online version omits the editor, but the PDF available at Forth Inc. still has it.
